# Analysis

Reflection: 1 
Since the mean is greater than the median it shows me that the distribution of data is postively skewed. 

Reflection: 2 
It doesn't surprise me because Washington is a progressive state that is inclusive of every individuals rights.

Reflection: 3 
An issue I found while looking at the variable was duplication in a sense. There were states that had variation in lowercase and uppercase letters that made a separate row when it could of been added with the original state. 

Reflection: 4
The change in protests does not surprise me because there has been much more social issues that have occurred within a year.

Reflection: 5
Protests from the BLM protests have led to the ban on neck restraints and decrease in funding within multiple states (Arizona,California,Colorado,and etc).

Reflection: 6
It shows the U.S. has a lot of work to do when it comes to issues of social justice.
