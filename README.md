# Analysis

Reflection: 1 
Since the mean is greater than the median it shows me that the distribution of data is postively skewed. 

Reflection: 2 
It doesn't surprise me because Washington is a progressive state that is inclusive of every individuals rights.

Reflection: 3 
An issue I found while looking at the variable was duplication in a sense. There were states that had variation in lowercase and uppercase letters that made a separate row when it could of been added with the original state. 

Reflection: 4
The change in protests does not surprise me because there has been much more social issues that have occurred within a year.

Reflection: 5
Protests from the BLM protests have led to the ban on neck restraints and decrease in funding within multiple states (Arizona,California,Colorado,and etc).

Reflection: 6
It shows the U.S. has a lot of work to do when it comes to issues of social justice.

This image is from the 2020 BLM marches. I used this picture because I believe it captures the essence of what protesting is and its importance to our rights. It is to fight for a better tomorrow without the right to protest there can never be a equitable society. 

# Critical reflection

How was the dataset collected and who collected the data?

The dataset was collected through reading local news reports every night.

What assumptions does the dataset make? List atleast two assumptions you identified. For inspiration, check out this blog post that describes one method for identifying data assumptions.

The first assumption I had about the dataset was that on the east coast there were much more protests which leads me to think that there are much more social justice issues there then anywhere in the nation. 


The second assumption I had about the dataset is how they collected it, they must have a big database to be able to catch up to every local news report on protests happening in the whole nation. Also, leads me to assume that smaller protests that had little or no news coverage could have been left out of the dataset.   

What data is missing from the dataset? Think about if there are any data points you would have liked to have seen in the dataset.

I would of liked to see color cordination within the dots on the map to signfy the number of protests there were in each city/state. Like a darker shade of blue would of mean that there were over 10 protests within that city alone and etc.

# Final Thoughts
What about the analysis surprised you?

What surprised me the most about the analysis was the number of protests that were going on throughout the years of 2019-2020. I knew that there were a lot however, I didn't know the values. 

What parts of this analysis did you find challenging?

I found most of the analysis challenging for me because I am still so new when comes to coding. 

What types of analysis do you wish you were able to do with the dataset, but currently don't have the technical skills to do?

I wish I was able group all of the events and compare the amount of attendees to show which social justice issues are at the top.
